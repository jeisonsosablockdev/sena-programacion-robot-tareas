## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- You want to discover which UniqueClub skill fits your current task
- You need to navigate the full 24-skill founder toolkit
- You're setting up AI workflows for your startup operations
- You want to understand how skills connect into end-to-end workflows
- You're installing or evaluating the complete founder toolkit

Do NOT use this skill if:
- You have a specific task already identified → use the individual skill directly (e.g., `pitch-deck-creator`, `competitor-tracker`)
- You need to execute a specific content or research task → this is a navigation/orientation layer, not an execution skill
- You want a single-purpose tool → choose the relevant skill from the catalog below

Typical triggers:
- 「UniqueClub工具包」「创始人技能套件」「有哪些AI创业工具」
- "founder toolkit", "uniqueclub skills", "startup AI workflow"
- 「创业必备工具」「工具包导航」

## Workflow

1. **探查 (Probe)** — Understand the user's goal. What are they trying to accomplish? Is it fundraising, market research, content creation, or daily operations? Ask clarifying questions if the task spans multiple categories.

2. **约束 (Constrain)** — Narrow down to the relevant category (Fundraising / Market Intelligence / Content Creation / Operations). Identify whether the user needs a single skill or a multi-skill workflow. Do not recommend skills outside the user's stated need.

3. **证据 (Evidence)** — Review the Skills Catalog below. Match the user's goal to the specific skill(s) based on purpose descriptions. Reference the Pre-built Workflows for common multi-skill sequences.

4. **执行 (Execute)** — Recommend the specific skill(s) with a brief explanation of why each fits. If a workflow is needed, lay out the sequence with the order of execution. Provide installation commands if the user hasn't installed the kit.

5. **验证 (Verify)** — Confirm the recommended skill(s) actually match the user's need. If the user's task is ambiguous, offer 2-3 options and ask which fits best. Cross-check that all recommended skills exist in the catalog.

6. **交付 (Deliver)** — Provide the skill name(s), installation instructions, and a one-line usage prompt for each. Point to the Quick Start section for setup. Direct the user to invoke the specific skill for execution.

**Market-to-Decision**

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Install the full kit:**
```bash
# Install all founder skills at once
npx skills add wulaosiji/founder-skills

# Or install specific skills only
npx skills add wulaosiji/founder-skills --skill pitch-deck-creator deck-web-converter investor-research
```

**Install individually:** Each skill can be installed standalone with `npx skills add wulaosiji/founder-skills --skill <skill-name>`.

## 🎓 Best Practices

**For Fundraising:**
1. Always create both PPT and HTML versions
2. Customize the deck for each investor meeting
3. Use investor-research to personalize your approach

**For Content:**

2. Maintain a consistent voice using the same skills
3. Track which formats resonate with your audience

**For Operations:**
1. Run founder-daily-brief every morning
2. Archive all meeting minutes for future reference
3. Set up competitor alerts for your top 5 competitors

## Output

A navigation recommendation containing: the relevant skill name(s), one-line purpose for each, installation command(s), and a suggested execution order if multiple skills are needed. Points the user to invoke the specific skill for actual task execution.

## Guardrails

**Anti-patterns:**
- NEVER execute a specific task through this navigation skill — always direct to the individual skill.
- Do NOT recommend skills that don't exist in the catalog above.
- Do NOT overwhelm the user with all 24 skills when only 1-2 are needed.

**Constraints:**
- This is a navigation and orientation layer, not an execution engine.
- Keep recommendations focused on the user's immediate goal.
- When a task spans categories, use the Pre-built Workflows as a starting point.
- All skills are part of the founder-skills repository; installation requires `npx skills`.
