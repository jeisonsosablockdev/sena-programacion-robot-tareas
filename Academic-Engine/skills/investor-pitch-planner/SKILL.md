# Investor Pitch Planner

> **One-line request → Complete fundraising pitch deck outline**: Through a structured SOP workflow, transform startup project information into a fundraising pitch deck outline covering six core modules — Problem → Solution → Market → Business Model → Team → The Ask — with data visualization recommendations for each module.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- The user needs to generate a fundraising pitch deck outline or business plan content framework in English
- The user mentions pitch decks, fundraising, investor presentations, or asks for help writing a deck
- The user is preparing to raise funds and needs to structure their story
- The user needs an English-language pitch deck outline (six modules + data visualization suggestions)

Do NOT use this skill if:
- The user needs an editable PPTX file → use `pitch-deck-creator` instead
- The user needs a Chinese pitch deck outline → use `fundraising-bp-planner` instead
- The user needs an 18-page Chinese-style PPT visual specification → use `business-plan-ppt` instead
- The user needs a specific narrative framework (Sequoia/YC/Raskin) → use the corresponding framework skill
- The user needs to convert an existing PPT to web → use `deck-web-converter`

Typical triggers:
- "help me write a pitch deck", "fundraising outline", "investor presentation structure"
- 「帮我写pitch deck」「融资大纲」「投资人材料」

## Quick Start

Simply provide a basic project description, and the Agent will automatically generate a fundraising pitch deck outline following this workflow:

```
User: We built a smart financial SaaS for SMBs and want to raise a Pre-A round
Agent: [Outputs a complete pitch deck outline following the SOP workflow]
```

## Workflow

本工作流遵循六步推进法，共6个步骤：
1. **探查 (Probe)**：动手前先完整读取全部输入，确认目标和约束。
2. **约束 (Constrain)**：验证输入完整性，设定边界和不可降级的交付标准，受阻时换通道。
3. **证据 (Evidence)**：每个数字必须来自输入、具体信源或可复现计算，收集支撑数据。
4. **执行 (Execute)**：调用脚本/API/生成内容，先给影响与结论，再给行动和必要证据。
5. **验证 (Verify)**：用"可能失败"的动作验证——不同于生成路径的方式回读输出。
6. **交付 (Deliver)**：返回结果，清理临时文件。

### Step 1: Probe (探查)
Fully read the user's project description, identify industry, target audience, product form, and development stage. Extract core information needed to build the pitch deck outline.

### Step 2: Constrain (约束)
Select interaction mode based on input detail level (Guided / Semi-automatic / Fully automatic / Express), set boundaries and non-negotiable delivery standards:
- All six modules must be complete (Problem, Solution, Market, Business Model, Team, The Ask)
- Every module must include data visualization recommendations
- Market size must have TAM/SAM/SOM three-tier breakdown
- Use of funds must have percentage allocation
- Milestones must have measurable metrics
- No hardcoded data — all placeholders marked with [brackets]
- When blocked, switch channels; do not degrade the deliverable

### Step 3: Evidence (证据)
Every number must come from input, specific sources, or reproducible calculations:
- Market size data must cite sources (public data / industry report / internal company data / estimate)
- Business metrics (user count, revenue, growth rate, retention, etc.) come from user input
- Team backgrounds come from user input; do not fabricate
- Self-estimated data must state assumptions
- Collect supporting data; do not invent traction or market size

### Step 4: Execute (执行)
Generate outline content module by module following the detailed SOP. Lead with impact and conclusion, then action and necessary evidence. See "Detailed SOP Workflow" below.

### Step 5: Verify (验证)
Verify item by item with the quality checklist — read back output using a method different from the generation path:
- All six modules complete
- Every module includes data visualization recommendations
- Market size has TAM/SAM/SOM three-tier breakdown
- Use of funds has percentage allocation
- Milestones have measurable metrics
- Data sources cited or flagged for user to provide
- Total slides within 10–15 slide recommendation
- Information To Be Provided list is non-empty
- No hardcoded data

### Step 6: Deliver (交付)
Return the complete pitch deck outline document (Markdown format), containing each module's key points, data visualization recommendations, and presentation tips. Clean up temporary files. If user provides feedback, identify the affected module and re-execute from the corresponding Phase, cascading updates to all downstream content.

## Detailed SOP Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Information Gathering

**Objective**: Extract core information needed to build the pitch deck outline from the user's description.

**Steps**:

1. **Parse the project description**: Identify the industry, target audience, product form, and development stage
2. **Ask clarifying questions** (up to 5 key questions):
   - What core pain point does the project solve? How do target users currently cope with this problem?
   - What stage is the product at? (Concept / MVP ready / Paying customers)
   - What key business metrics can you share? (User count, revenue, growth rate, retention rate, etc.)
   - What are the core team members' backgrounds? (Especially industry-relevant experience)
   - What is the target fundraising amount and intended use of funds?
3. **If the user asks to skip clarification**, proceed with reasonable assumptions and flag them in the "Information To Be Provided" section of the outline

**Output**: Project information summary (under 200 words)

---

### Phase 2: Problem Definition (Problem)

   - Quantify the pain point's impact (time cost, financial loss, efficiency loss, etc.)

2. **Suggested outline content**:
   - Core pain point statement (1 sentence)
   - Current state description (how users cope today)
   - Scale and impact of the pain point

3. **Data visualization recommendations**:

   | Data Type | Presentation Format | Notes |
   |-----------|-------------------|-------|
   | Scale of affected users | Large-font number + brief annotation | e.g., "32 million SMBs face this problem" |
   | Shortcomings of existing solutions | Comparison table (Current vs. Ideal) | Highlight the gap |
   | Losses caused by the pain point | Single key figure | e.g., "Each company wastes $XX per year on average" |

**Output**: Problem module outline + data visualization recommendations
